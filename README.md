The robot is controlled by a pSoC on the top of our designed PCB.
The map is from a light projector on the ceiling. Our PCB has sensor circuits that tell the robot its position.
Also, we use RF module to let robot know its coordiate.

Movement logic for the robot and a star algorithm is coded in C.
